## Hi dear!!👋

<!--
**IvumiYo/IvumiYo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
Yo! I'm a student who’s into programming and tech stuff.  
I like messing around with code, learning new tools, and figuring out how things work under the hood.

I'm always open to new experiences, projects, and fresh challenges — whether it’s learning a new language, trying a new framework, or building something from scratch.

Currently learning, experimenting, and leveling up 🚀  
Always ready to start something new.
